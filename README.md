# World Chat

As the name of the application it is a chat application.
And ofcourse it's real time. This project entirely written by me.
To build this project I use main three softwares... this are very
popualr. This softwares are NODE.js, REACT.js and ofcourse the heart
of the project socket.io the greate library of NODE.js. If any body 
want to contribute on this project you are vary vary welcome...



## Documentation

The application is vary simple to use.
Just open the application and it is ask for entering your name
what ever you want to enter as your name you can enter at the field.
After entering just click the join button bellow the field or simply
press enter and you good to go. At the moment of your joining as a 
connector you can chat with other active connector on the application.

## Appendix

This chat dosen't use any kind of databases so your chat on longer
gonna saved in the application, as soon as you refrash the page or
close the tab your saved chat gonna remove .
So be carefull about this the chat dosen't made for important
porpouse how ever in future maybe I'll implement the database than
it will be more safe but for now it is not an ideal application it 
is just a prototype you can say for fun and learn.
